# AllesEkar
Allesfezs Ekarschubi is a wargame developed by a small team in Obyxel with a few core concepts in mind.
* All-Era. The wargame encompases every technological and societal era, from prehistoric societies to the most futuristic of battlefronts.
* Active-Reactive. During a player's active turn, other players are made to take on a reactive role, choosing what their units do in response.
* Scalable. This wargame accompanies any number of models, and all types of models. Small skirmishes with meideval warbands to futuristic warfare with vehicles and monsters.
* Progression. This system accomodates the time between games, allowing players to establish narritive-driven battles with units improving over time.

This project takes inspiration from a number of wargaming systems, namely Corvus Belli's Infinity Code One and N4, CRUX Universal Wargaming, aspects from other wargames and some tabletop roleplaying systems. A specific part of this project, namely the Motoric attribute, is inspired by Disco Elysium's motorics skill.

If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this game better, more balanced, or more interesting, please get in contact.
