Allesfezs Ekarshubi is a tabletop wargaming system popular in Xeiat originally developed in Obyxel. It is a universal wargaming system designed with several different goals in mind.

- All-era. Allesfezs is a wargame not set in any particular time period. Ranged weaponry span from the earliest javelins to laser rifles, melee weapons from the rock to the energy sword.
- Active-Reactive. It doesn’t matter whose active turn it is, the opposing player needs to react in response to what the active player does during this round. This can be anything from blocking, dodging, readying a shield, or shooting a gun.
- Scalable. This game accompanies any number of models, and all types of models. A small warband to a grand clash in war, a small taskforce to an army. Everything is accounted for, individual soldiers, squads, statics, and vehicles.
- Progression. Although it isn’t often used, the ability for units in the game to gain experience as time goes on is a favourite among players who want to build a narrative with their games. The flexible equipment style leans into this, allowing units to ‘pick up’ weapons from battlefields and buy new ones to outfit their units in.

These being the core tenants, its important to know where they came from.

I have participated in several war gaming systems and I have browsed the rules of a few.

- Warhammer 40k 7th, 9th, and 10th.
- Infinity Code One
- Victory at Sea
- Warhammer Kill Team
- CRUX universal wargaming system (learnt but not played)
- The Elder Scrolls Call to Arms (browsed)

So I think I have enough case studies to fulfil my wargame dreams. I mean, I modified D&D to a point where I can claim it to my own, and all I had was itself to base it off.

The core idea is from CRUX, which is actually kinda a bad wargaming system. Its just bad. It just sucks. But the ideas are there, and the ideas are good. Warhammer games are like the average, but they are commendable for their scale and vehicles. Infinity Code One to me is the gold standard, but its specific mechanics are closely tied to the game’s gun tactics and low scale. Warhammer kill team is also nice, and has rules for progression. I didn’t look much into the Elder Scrolls Call to Arms but it had a pretty interesting flowchart behaviours for not player controlled units.

I think first I need to start with the stats. Here’s my gathering from the case studies.

Warhammer uses d6s for their rolls, which makes sense because of its simplicity and Warhammer’s large scale. I want this game to be split into units, which can either be single models for small scale battles or squads for larger scale battles. I also want to use d20s, but I think I will cross this bridge when I come to it

Anyway, pretty much every wargame has a movement stat. In Code One, this movement stat is split into two. The first value being the first move and the second being the uuh second. Most wargames split their weapon skills between close quarters and ranged.

I think it makes sense to inherit some skill system for certain types of each weapon.

How about there are weapon classes, and you have skills in a certain weapon class. This way, if you are an expert in the bow youItem aren’t an expert in firearms. I’ll list the weapon skill classes I can think of. These are common skill classes, so these do not encapsulate every skill as many exotic weapons like whips will have their own.

- One-handed striking (swords, maces…)
- Finesse stabbing (rapiers, spears…)
- Hooking (axes, hooks, fencing daggers…)
- Two-handed striking (longswords, great axes, great maces…)
- Polearms (glaives, poleaxe, halberds…)
- Contact (brass knuckles, claws, daggers, unarmed…)
- Whips
- Thrown (rocks, javelins, slings, daggers)
- Bows (bows)
- Firearm (crossbows, arquebuses, pistols, rifles…)
- Artillery (trebuchet, cannons, ballistae…)
- Improvised (chairs, bottles, whatever really)

Some weapons are used in a wholly unique way. For these weapons, you need a skill special to them.

There’s a difference between skills, like combat, elements of equipment, like armour, and physical characteristics of a unit, like strength, dexterity, and willpower, that many wargame systems just put in the same place. I can’t do this. Instead, I’m going to have to have core attributes, core skills, and then special skills since there’s a difference between knowing how to use a weapon, and special skills like jumping real good.

I still think its useful to have a generic skill to differ to if you don’t have a specific skill in a weapon. This is the Motoric skill, taken straight from Disco Elysium’s Motorics. Motorics encompasses hand-eye coordination, perception, reaction speed, and interfacing.

The next is physique, which is how inherently strong you are. Its the ability to exert force, its musculature.

Maybe the next should be willpower, which can snatch all manner of things like leadership, constitution,

Toughness is a consideration, but its mostly a take from Warhammer. It might not be necessary, since most people are using human-sized models anyway, and come to think of it I’m not actually a big fan of toughness in Warhammer when ability to resist damage is instead taken up by things like armour and number of wounds.

Wounds is a must have. I think I’ll go the Infinity route and have standard humans have a single wound all the time, and things like super soldiers get two wounds. Even in Code One, massive tanks like the Maghariba guard only get 3 wounds, but its called something like structure. I might try to find another word other than wounds that also applies to our robot counterparts.

I’m wondering if we need another skill cause like magic. In Infinity, magic (or hacking whatever) is part of willpower. In Warhammer, it is separate from skills in 9th. In CRUX its either pre or apt (being an issue because of how influential pre is as a skill)

So on a unit’s profile, the topmost collection of attributes are

- Motoric (MOT)
- Physique (PHY)
- Willpower (WIL)
- Wounds/Structure (W)

Then the important information but not explicitly part of the attributes are

- Movement (MOV)
- Weapon Skill Class Aptitude (WSC)
- Armour (ARM)
- Reactions (REC)

A quick word on how I’m doing actions in this. I really like Infinity’s half action thing, so I might just give units two actions to work with. I need to distinguish somehow between actions you can’t use as your first action, like shooting and magic, because then that would let you shoot twice or magic twice and I’m not a big fan of that. Maybe I stick to Infinity’s ‘movement action’ then ‘action’ method to let players use another move or do something useful with their turn. 

Movement actions are

- Move
- Reload
- Idle
- Discover (for stealth)

OH! Just real quick, I think having a reaction system would be cool, but because the game’s supposed to be a bit more everything moving than Infinity’s specially placed orders, I think it would make more sense if units had a set number of reactions they could perform during the opponent’s active turn. This way, you can decide if you want a unit to react to the unit the enemy is using, or if you want to reserve their reactions for another moving enemy unit.

I think reactions make sense to happen on line of sight and within some activation range. As is in Infinity, this works great for the cover rich, low model battles that happen there. I’m imagining this system for the opposite though, like the grand medieval battlefield. Like, you move your infantry squad 8” forwards only for them to be reauctioned to death by enemy crossbow units. The way I get past this is with the whole reloading system. Crossbows might have two or three reactions, but if they have a loaded crossbow they can only shoot it during one of these reactions. For the other reactions, they have to pick one of the other options.

Here's some ideas of what reactions should be.

- Attack (melee or with ranged, but only if loaded)
- Discover (for stealth)
- Dodge / Adjust. This skill will exclusively be to slightly move your models in response to an enemy movement or attack. If the enemy attacked, this would be a face to face roll to see if your dodge is successful and negates the attack.
- Block. This lets a unit block an incoming attack and be more sure that they’ll stop the enemy attack than if they counterattacked. Might be useful for stalling, and should be more effective than dodging incoming enemy fire.
- Magics. Maybe some magics can be used in a reaction.
- Items and special skills.

Similarly, non-movement actions would be

- Attack
- Interface (with equipment, objectives, statics, and the like)
- Dodge / Adjust. Maybe to move with less chance of getting hit by enemy fire, as opposed to taking the rest of your move you can dodge your dodge distance.
- Magics.
- Items and special skills.

And maybe there can be some big actions like jump and climb, that can turn into actions if a unit has a particular skill like “acrobat” or smthn.

I think I should develop stealth, because it’s a pretty cool idea at all scales. In the small scale, it would be cool if a unit is hidden and can’t be shot at or differentiated from other hidden units. Hidden units should be able to do stealth attacks, and move between cover without being spotted (triggering reactions). It would even be cool at grander scales, where an entire squad hides from detection. This would be a lot easier to spot, but if the squad was small, it might be a viable tactic. To ensure stealth isn’t overpowered and an opportunity to get free stealth attacks, units should only be able to enter stealth if they are behind a cover and haven’t been seen by any enemies this turn. Perhaps only certain units should be able to re-enter stealth, assuming that stealth units start the game in stealth.

I think I should start to develop the rolling system.

I would love for high to be good, but I just think this isn’t possible if I want high skill numbers to be good.

I have workshopped this solution and have came up with an answer.

When making a roll, you have to roll higher than your skill number, where lower numbers are good. This works because high rolls are good, and skills are ordered on a rank-based system (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc..). Some units just have exceptionally good skills, say an ace marksman that never misses. Their skill might look like MOT 8 (master (+10) marksman). In this case, you have to roll higher than an 8 and add 10 to your roll. This means if your actual dice rolls a 2, it would plus ten and become 12. If you rolled a 1, either you auto fail (a possibility) or due to how good you are at shooting you literally cannot fail. More importantly, this system means that if you rolled a 11, you would add 10 to it and it would become 21 and a critical hit, giving some fun extra power.

This does, however, mean that if you are a novice (+2) a 18 is a crit. This needs changing.

I could quite easily say that instead of adding to your roll, they are actually lowering the difficulty, but after you’ve reached 1 difficulty the bonuses start adding on to your rolls, making more successful numbers crits. That way, in the example above, only 17-20 would be crits. The maximum lowest crit roll you could achieve would be 10, if you have 1 default in the attribute and are an expert in the skill.

I might expand on skill things right now.

I think it makes sense for units to have achieved a certain level of skill in a skill. These are bonuses that are multiples of 2. They would go unknown (+0, default), Novice (+2), Proficient (+4), Adept (+6), Expert (+8) and Master (+10)

These could affect skills of anything, like you might be a proficient dodger, in which case all of your dodge rolls would get bonuses. Maybe there’s a doctoring skill that you’re a master of, so you always successfully heal your patients.

Going back to rolls, when you and your opponent are doing rolls in attempts to hinder each other (say, attacking each other or one of you attacks while the other dodges) then you both roll against your skills, but this time rolls cancel lower rolls out.

Frequently you might be making several d20 rolls against an opponent rolling one or more d20s. This might happen if you’re shooting an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, or if you get multiple melee attacks. In these cases, cancelling rolls should work from a down-up bases, so any low roll cancels lower rolls before being cancelled themselves by higher rolls. I’m sure that makes sense.

To summarise:

Allesfezs Ekarshubi is a tabletop wargame initially developed by a team based in Obyxel with four main goals in mind.

- All-Era. Allesfezs Ekarshubi applies to every era of combat, from the dawn of warfare to the distant future.
- Active-Reactive. Players are kept in the game even when it isn’t their turn, as their units can react to actions opposing units take.
- Scalable. Allesfezs Ekarshubi applies to all scales of combat, from small skirmishes to wide wars. Every model is accounted for, such as foot soldiers, monsters, and vehicles.
- Progression. Players may choose to undertake long, narrative-driven battles where their units gain experience and die over the course of several games.

The Unit is the core part of Allesfezs. Units usually encompass a model but can also represent groups of models that share common attributes and skills. When a unit is several models, this is called a squad.  Vehicles become a special type of unit when crewed by normal units. Vehicles move, shoot, and fight like any other unit, but they can be used as cover and destroyed, sometimes killing or harming its crew. Monsters, or more lovingly big units, are the same as any other unit but are characterised by their abnormally large sizes and larger wound pools.

Units have a set of primary attributes, secondary attributes, skills, and special skills. Then, they have equipment. The primary attributes are:

- Motorics (MOT). This represents a unit’s hand-eye coordination, perception, reaction speed, and interfacing abilities.
- Physique (PHY). This represents a unit’s more physical skills such as strength and dexterity.
- Willpower (WIL). This represents a unit’s mental skills such as leadership, intelligence, and magics.
- Structure (STR). This represents a unit’s ability to take hits before falling. Most units will only ever have one structure, but larger units like super soldiers and vehicles get more.

The secondary attributes are displayed clearly on a unit’s profile, but are not exclusive or the base of a unit’s profile like primary attributes are. These are:

- Movement (MOV). This is how far a unit moves when they make a movement action. It is based on physique and size.
- Weapon Skill Class Aptitudes (WSC). Allesfezs has several different weapon skill classes, which are weapons that share common skills. Your weapon skill class aptitudes are important when making attacks, so the relevant skills for the weapons a unit holds are displayed as attributes There are two spaces for WSC. WSCC and WSCR, one for your primary ranged weapon and another for your primary close combat weapon.
- Armour (ARM). Armour is based on your armour equipment, but is important when defending against attacks so it is displayed as an attribute.
- Reactions (REC). This determines how many reactions a unit gets to make during the opposing active turns. It is based on a units Motorics

In Allesfezs, having low primary attributes is good, and can be thought of as an ordinal system (1st, 2nd, 3rd) When you make a skill check, most commonly to perform an attack, you roll a d20 and the result must be higher than the value of the attribute, taking into account modifiers. The most common modifier is your aptitude in a skill. There are five aptitudes for skills and the default, which are all multiples of two. The label corresponding to these aptitudes are for decoration.

- Inexperienced (+0). This is the default for all unspecified skills
- Novice (+2)
- Proficient (+4)
- Adept (+6)
- Expert (+8)
- Master (+10)

When determining the target value for a skill check roll, you minus the aptitude from the attribute. When the attribute becomes 1, instead of negating the attribute with the aptitude, you instead add it to your roll. At all times, a roll of 20 or above, natural or not, is a critical hit. There is no automatic failure. If a unit makes a reaction to oppose another action, they are rolled as face-to-face rolls. In this, each unit must beat their target value for their roll to count. In addition to this, rolls cancel all lower rolls. The lowest rolls are checked for cancellation first, meaning a roll may cancel out other rolls before being cancelled itself. Ties are both successful and do not cancel each other out.

The different weapon skill classes are

- One-handed striking (swords, maces…)
- Finesse stabbing (rapiers, spears…)
- Hooking (axes, hooks, fencing daggers…)
- Two-handed striking (longswords, great axes, great maces…)
- Polearms (glaives, poleaxe, halberds…)
- Contact (brass knuckles, claws, daggers, unarmed…)
- Whips
- Thrown (rocks, javelins, slings, daggers)
- Bows (bows)
- Firearm (crossbows, arquebuses, pistols, rifles…)
- Artillery (trebuchet, cannons, ballistae…)
- Improvised (chairs, bottles, whatever really)

Certain weapons are unlike any other, in which case they have their own skill class for aptitude.

During a player’s active turn, they decide which of their units they activate. They can then make a movement action, and a second action. If, during the movement action, an enemy unit can see the activated unit or if the activated unit enters within the enemy unit’s zone of control, it may choose to make a reaction. Units can only react as many times as their REC attribute during the enemy turn, meaning that units need to be careful about when they react. For the second action, the activated unit may make another movement action, or do any other available action.

The movement actions are

- Move
- Reload
- Idle
- Discover (for stealth)

The reactions are

- Attack (melee or with ranged, but only if loaded)
- Discover (for stealth)
- Dodge / Adjust. You can move the reacting unit a short distance, derived from their movement attribute. If dodge is done in reaction to an attack, it is a face-to-face roll against the enemy’s attack.
- Block. Melee weapons may be used to block melee weapon attacks, and shields can be used to block ranged attacks. Blocking is similar to the dodge reaction, but instead of moving a short distance, you are more likely to avoid damage.
- Magics. Some magic abilities can be used in a reaction.
- Many Items and special skills are used as reactions.

The actions are

- Attack
- Interface (with equipment, objectives, statics, and the like)
- Dodge / Adjust. If used as a main action, it is used to avoid damage taken from an enemy attack reaction while still moving an additional distance.
- Block. If it is used as a main action, it lets you move and activate a reaction while still being able to resist incoming attack reactions.
- Magics. Almost all magics are used as an action.
- Items and special skills. Almost all items and special skills that do not have passive effects are used as actions.

- There are also full actions, which use the movement action and the second action. These are:
- Acrobatics. Used to navigate terrain such as jump over short gaps or climb up walls.
- Hidden Move. Used while in stealth to move between two pieces of cover without provoking reactions.
- Magics. Some magics use both actions.
- Items and special skills. Some items and special skills use both actions.

Weapons in Allesfezs have profiles containing their attributes. These are

- Name.
- Skill Class.
- Ranges.
- Attacks. Often modified by the MOT attribute.
- Strength. For many melee weapon types, this is a modification of the PHY attribute.
- Ammunition Type.
- Traits. These are additional attributes that make weapons more flexible in the game.

Anyway, that’s done with the summary.

I was thinking about the normal attributes the regular dude would have. I workshopped this a bit, and I reckon 14s across the board would make sense. Like, if someone randomly picked up a bow I’m sure they’d be able to hit the target 30% of the time. An average medieval soldier might have skills like MOT 11 and OHS Proficient, meaning they would aim for a 7 on attacks (65%), subject to the enemy, and an 11 if they just picked up a bow (45%). This means that someone with average motorics, 14, who is proficient with a weapon, would hit with that weapon 50% of the time, which to me makes sense because they haven’t improved their motorics.

Now I have the base line, 14, I need to figure out what each of the deviations mean, and how capable I think certain folks should be.

I’ll add skills here as I think of them:

DETECTION – used for revealing stealth. SWIM – a movement skill used for traversing water. DIVING – a movement skill used for traversing water without provoking reactions. ELUSIVE – a skill that increases the difficulty of incoming attacks. TANKS – a set of skills relevant to the operation and maintenance of tank vehicles. ENGINEERING – a set of skills relevant to the repair of vehicles and construction of some things. SURVIVAL – a set of skills that improve a unit’s resilience to environmental factors. AIRBORNE – a skill that allows units to deploy forwards, or drop in during the game.

14 – 1, 13 – 2, 12 – 2, 11 – 3, 10 – 3, 9 - 4

Y know what I’m sure I can figure it out

So in addition to the aptitude levels, the attributes have standard numbers.

12 is the generic capabilities of an average person

11 is the capabilities of someone who’s naturally talented in that regard, or who practice in this regard.

10 in an attribute means a unit has a solid level of capability in relation to the things the attribute involves. They can comfortably handle unfamiliar tasks.

9 in an attribute would mean a unit possesses notably well capabilities, and would perform well in competitive scenarios that demand this attribute.

8 would mean the unit possesses impressive capabilities in the attribute. They excel in tasks relating to the attribute.

7 in an attribute means this unit is exceptionally well trained and dedicates their life to the attribute as a whole.

Remember that although it might seem quite dire that someone with impressive capabilities only succeed 50% of the time, this is in tasks they are unfamiliar with as units would have aptitude for things they do know how to do. Someone like an Olympic acrobat would have expertise in an acrobatics skill, and might have 12 or 11 in motoric. With a 12, they would comfortably be able to handle other physique tasks like strength-based tasks, and they would succeed 40% of the time. They would need to surpass a 4 if they did an acrobatics check though, which is 80% of the time.

If you had like an 8 in a skill, you would be more or less an adept in every task related to that skill, in relation to an average person. Someone with an 8 in motorics would perform as well with a weapon they are unfamiliar with as a commoner who is adept in the weapon.

I’m going to start thinking about the points system.

The main source of power here is equipment, like a caveperson with a gun is someone with a gun, and a marksman with a club is someone with a club.

The default profile is a person with 14 in all stats and no equipment or skills.

How many points should they cost?

Because technically, the worst profile would be someone with 20 in all stats (forcing you to always hit crits) with no skills or equipment. But in the rules, 16 is the worst you can go with an attribute, giving you only a 25% chance of success with anything. I might make this 17 instead, that way the worst can be 20%. I’ll only do this as a base for the point system, so the empty profile with 17s all round would cost one point.

With that said, how many blank people is a medieval knight worth? How much of that is given to their equipment, skills, and attributes?

Okay, so lets say this is the default profile.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Default Person|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|MOT|PHY|WIL|STR|MOV|WSCC|WSCR|ARM|REC|
|14|14|14|1|4”|+0|n/a|n/a|1|
|No skills|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Equipment:|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

All default person can do is run up to people and punch them with an unarmed strike.

Unarmed strikes have 20-PHY damage, which in this case is 6. If they attacked another default person, that default person would be able to make a reaction to attack them back. They would both have a 0.09% chance of killing each other. They would likely be fist fighting for many, many turns, and I think this makes sense.

Give them both revolvers, and all of a sudden they have a 24% chance to kill each other. The second one of them figures out how a revolver works and how to point and shoot effectively, the chance goes to 32%. The chances probably slowly increase as time goes on.

Maybe I can judge how much attribute increases cost using the knowledge of how many things they really affect?

MOTorics affects every attack with any weapon, but since units are likely to be always using the same type of weapon this matters less. Motorics is also used when piloting vehicles, interfacing with scenario objectives, and it determines how many reactions they get. Reactions are pretty significant, as it basically gives a unit a massive action economy during their reactive turn. This is a lot less useful if they aren’t using a gun, so maybe I should make ranged weapon skills cost more?

PHYsique is used when dodging and blocking, movement speed, resistances to things like magic. It seems a little less important to a wargame than MOTorics, but since dodging and movement speed are pretty important skills it might justify physique costing as much as motorics to increase.

WILlpower is used for intelligence, the unimplemented pressure tests, and all magic. It really isn’t useful, unless I make pressure tests significant enough, and I might.

Structure is immutable so doesn’t really need a point cost for it.

Lets have a quick look at someone with 13 in their attributes. This small change would make them 5% more likely to be successful at stuff. How much is this worth? How much is 10% worth? Are all of these equally of more worth, or does the worth go up as the attributes increase?

I’m going to mock up a quick table.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Score**|**Cost**|**cumulative cost**|
|**17**|0|0|
|**16**|1|1|
|**15**|2|3|
|**14**|3|6|
|**13**|5|11|
|**12**|10|21|
|**11**|20|41|
|**10**|30|71|
|**9**|50|121|

This is the cost to go from one level to another. This would actually make the default person worth 6 per attribute and be 19 points.

Onto aptitude costs, it’s a bit more tricky. Standard attack pattern weapons get 1 extra attack for each extra aptitude, and I need to somehow figure this into the cost. I will also add minimum associated attribute, since someone with proficiency should have a 13 in the attribute its related to.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Aptitude**|**Cost**|**Cumulative COst**|**Min attribute**|
|**+0**|0|0|n/a|
|**+2**|4|4|14|
|**+4**|6|10|13|
|**+6**|8|18|13|
|**+8**|12|30|12|
|**+10**|15|45|12|

For some basic understanding, here’s two unit profiles.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Generalist Hitty Person (84 points)|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|MOT|PHY|WIL|STR|MOV|WSCC|WSCR|ARM|REC|
|10|14|14|1|4”|+0|n/a|n/a|4|
|No skills|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Equipment:|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Specialist Hitty Person (42 points)|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|MOT|PHY|WIL|STR|MOV|WSCC|WSCR|ARM|REC|
|13|14|14|1|4”|+0|n/a|n/a|2|
|Contact (+6)|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Equipment:|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

In this example, generalist hitty has a 55% chance to hit. Specialist hitty person has a 70% chance to hit (I think). Generalist hitty costs twice as much, which is obviously not worth it if you’re just going in on it 1 on 1, but given how generalist hitty can pick up any weapon and have a 55% chance of hitting, and that they will also interact with consoles more efficiently, and that they will be able to make twice as many reactions, this cost suddenly becomes justified.

Then there’s weaponry. How much is that worth?

Weaponry should have its own point cost system, given how they have their own profiles.

The user of this equipment will have 13 mot and +4 to whatever weapon skill class they need. They will be assumed to have the optimal range modifier of +2 if it is a ranged weapon.

So, here are the things I have to consider for a weapon.

First, the unarmed strike:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Name|Range|Damage|Attacks|Skill Class|Special rules|
|Unarmed Strike|CQ|*|Standard|Contact|*Deals 20-PHY crush damage|

This costs nothing. Having a model on the table costs 1 point, so basically having 19 units with 17 in all attributes costs the same as having one model with 14 in all attributes. This seems quite unbalanced, hold on.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Rubbish Person|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|MOT|PHY|WIL|STR|MOV|WSCC|WSCR|ARM|REC|
|17|17|17|1|4”|+0|n/a|n/a|1|
|No skills|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Equipment:|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Each rubbish person would have a 2% chance to kill. A default person would have a 9% chance to kill. I guess this could be balanced by giving the default person a weapon like a sword with 12 damage. Which would increase their chance to 18%. Still, this is only worth 9 rubbish people, and the additional cost would be not good. I could drop the cost of attribute costs.

Anyway, onto weaponry!

There are 8 ranges. CQ should not cost anything. A weapon being ranged should immediately shoot its cost up by quite a bit. Each range has its own benefits too, but it makes sense for longer ranges to cost more.

Damage types also make sense to cost, as some damage types are more powerful than others. The typical damages (slash, crush, pierce) should cost nothing or maybe pierce costs low like 2 points. The actual damage variable should cost something as well, but since unarmoured strikes have default 8, the damage should increase from there and potentially take away if it goes under 8.

Attack type costs are a bit hard to work with. Standard attack type increases attacks with aptitude, whereas quick gives twice that amount of attacks. Since increasing attacks doubles effectiveness, quick should multiply the cost of the weapon by two. The other attack types (Manual, Burst, Automatic) come with a set amount of attacks. I have no idea how I’m going to balance these. Since these weapon types are usually ranged. You know what, I’m just going to do some costs.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Attacks**|**Cost**|
|**Standard**|*1 for CQ, *2.5 for ranged|
|**Quick**|*2 for CQ, *5 for ranged|
|**Manual N**|*N|
|**Burst N**|*N|
|**Automatic N**|*N|

I think this rationale makes sense. It keeps melee weapons low cost while making the fast-firing modern ranged weaponry sufficiently priced.

As for damage, 6 is the unarmoured default damage, but I think 8 should be the default as unarmoured is a last resort most of the time. Using my default attacker profile (13 MOT and +4 in apt), 8 has a 22% chance of killing. In fact, here’s a table:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Damage**|**Kill Chance**|**Adjusted Cost**|
|**8**|22%|0|
|**9**|25%|2|
|**10**|28%|4|
|**11**|30%|6|
|**12**|33%|8|
|**13**|36%|10|
|**14**|39%|12|
|**15**||14|
|**16**||16|
|**17**||18|
|**18**||20|

I’m not going to do the rest because it’s a pretty simple GP of +0.0275. I’ll just increase the cost by two for each damage.

Then theres the damage types. I literally do not know how powerful each of these are, but their power is determined by armours and how common each damage type has a specific resistance. I’ll ballpark it now.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Damage Type**|**Cost**|
|**Slash**|0|
|**crush**|0|
|**pierce**|0|
|**bullet**|0|
|**AP**|10|
|**Laser**|12|
|**Plasma**|16|

My rational here is that bullet is usually factored in the overbearing cost of being a ranged weapon. AP weapons usually surpass bullet resistances, and weapons of these types are generally not resisted much by armours. I need to develop armours a lot more, as all I have now are a couple basic medieval armour types and a Kevlar vest. 

Almost forgot the ranges. I’m just gonna put this here.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Range**|**Cost**|
|**SR**|5|
|**ASR**|10|
|**MR**|8|
|**AMR (T)**|14+T|
|**LR**|18|
|**AR**|22|
|**AAR**|30|

I don’t really have any specific rational, these are all just feelings I have on how powerful they are in relation to one another, with 5 being the default short range.

I’m not going to add costs to skill classes, but costs to special rules should probably have something.

Heres a few weapons to cost up:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sword|CQ|Slash 12|Standard|OHS||
|Poleaxe|CQ|S/C/P 14|Standard|THS|Two-Handed, options|
|Musket|MR|Bullet 15|Manual 1|Firearm|Ammo (1), Long reload, Bayonet|
|Rifle|MR|Bullet 18|Standard|Firearm|Ammo (8), Bayonet|
|Assault Rifle|AMR (+2)|Bullet 18|Standard|Firearm|Ammo (20)|

 Sword costs only 8. Poleaxe costs 13 assuming two-handed removes 2 points and options adds 3. Musket would cost 19, with 1 for ammo 1, and -4 for long reload. Rifle costs 41 because I think costs should be evaluated left to right, with special rules being added after the attacks multiplies it all. I’m doing 2 for bayonet. Assault rifle would total up to 98. Probably fair. This does make default person with an assault rifle cost 117 points, worth roughly four default people with swords. This feels right. Still need to fix the swarming issue, but I’ll do that later.

Real quick, every point of armour reduces the chance of death by 0.0275, and I cannot be bothered to figure out differing damage types at this very moment. I’ll just do a +2 for every armour point.

# Major rebalance patch
So after playtesting the game a bit, i've realised serious flaws in its balancing, namely that of skills and armour.
Skills are too good.

First, I'm going to tackle the attribute issues. 
I'm going to more carefully assess the capabilities of units from Allesfezs main inspiration, Infinity.
A Ghulam has a BS of 11 and a CC of 14. Since you need to roll lower than this to succeed, in AllesEkar, this would amount to a firearms of 9 and a CQ attack skill of 6. I think CQ is elevated because of game balance. 
Considering that a Ghulam is your standard infantry, this would kind of work for a standard infantry in AllesEkar, where they have a 13 attribute and +4 "proficient" skill aptitude.
But the second they get slightly stronger, it kinda breaks down. For example, Khawarij has a BS of 13, which is a 7, which would be someone "practiced" with "adept" capabilities.
I think the first task and purpose is to lower the aptitude scores. It would do the game balance great service if I kept modifiers chromatic instead of whole tonal. So, I propose the new set of aptitude scores:
- Inexperienced (+0 or not defined). This is the default for skills undefined.
- Novice (+1). A unit has a basic understanding of the skill
- Proficient (+2). A unit is able to perform the skill effectively.
- Adept (+3). A unit is well familiarised with the skill.
- Expert (+4). A unit has a thorough understanding of the skill.
- Master (+5). A unit has an exhaustive understanding of the skill and its intricacies.

Lowering the power of the aptitudes will hopefully create a more balanced game by giving more control over modifiers (and not just limiting them to evens). 
I think the attributes are fine for now. They range from 17 to 9, which is cool. The only issue now is "complete mastery" would land someone with a 4 to match or beat. This gives an 85% success rate which come to think of it is completely fair.

As for the armour imbalances, I might need to reconsider damage as a whole.
I think its in order I discuss bullet calibre and comparisons to getting hit with things like swords
A sword deals 12 damage. A simple low calibre bullet deals 15 bullet damage.
I think i will reassess how melee damage works. I even say that PH is an influencer for melee damage in many ways, and I need to start considering how these melee weapons work as a "force multiplier" rather than a flat damage type such as bullet weapons.
So maybe swords offer a simple damage of PH-2. This would mean their damage would scale with the PH of their user, making PH a more valuable skill and point cost for damage infinitely more difficult to calculate.
I think i might separate armour values more also, because having 5 protection against damage types like Slash and Crush makes more sense than having 5 protection against bullets. Like in Infinity heavily mechd up Janissaries only have 4 armour, which is supposed to protect against bullets, but you can imagine their high tech metal suits almost entirely mitigate slashing damage
So I might divide damage into two types, a simple and advanced type. The idea is that simple damage types are quite easy to defend against, so armour points against them cost less. Advanced damage types are harder to defend against, so armour points against them cost a lot.

# Team rolls
I want to actually figure out how im going to do teams.
So the whole idea is to combine a pack of n identical agents and have them do everything together to simplify the game when played with large groups.
Let's define the problem:
The probability that a dice roll is a success is calculated by
$$P(\text{success})=\frac{20-s+1}{20}$$
where s is the target score, and its a meet or beet. So the success of trying to beat a 12 would be 45%

But i want to model a team success probability, with a distribution. The idea is that while some actions will have uniform success (like movement actions), many actions like combat ones would have a distributed success, meaning that only a percentage of models would succeed.
This can be modelled by a Bernoulli distribution like so:
So the probability of k successes in k trials is given by the formula
$$P(k;n,p)=C(n,k)\times ^k \times (1-p)^{n-k}$$
where p is the success rate above. This calculates the probability of having exactly that many successes, which is useful for calculations but not so useful if we want to model this in a dice roll.
What we really want is the probability that at least n agents succeeded. This could give us something better to abstract as a dice roll.
$$P(X\geq n)=\sum_{i=n}^k{P(X=i)}$$
Given all this maths, I think i've come up with a way to model the probability distribution using dice.
I present to you: the summed dice roll!
the idea is that when you roll two dice and sum them up, that number then falls on a probability distribution.
So what if we rolled one team dice, a d20, and then two other dice, lets say d10s, as a distribution dice?
The idea is that you can then add these up and find the distribution of successes and failures.

So under this model, the team roll would be a d20, then a distribution dice of 2d5.
The chance of getting a 6 is 20%. This should mean that the variance is on the team roll. If you got a 8 with 12% chance, then the variance would be higher than the team roll by two marks. If you got a 3 with 8% chance, then the variance would be higher than the team roll by 3 marks.
![[2d5 distribution.png]]
Okay, so, the idea here is a buffer.

given a success value s, and a roll r, the buffer is r - s. This means that if you roll above the value, you have more of a buffer for a bad distribution roll. The same applies in reverse, if the buffer is negative you'll need a better distribution roll to have more of your guys still succeed.
What I want to do is force a player with a team to do more calculation.
The buffer is a certain percentage of the team, built around 10 team members. So a buffer of 2 with 10 team members would be a buffer of 2, whereas a buffer of 2 with 20 team members would be a buffer of 4. 
Now, you need to use the distribution dice. Lets say you rolled badly and got a 3. With a team of 10, the idea is that the distribution performance is 3-6, or -3. This means that 3 of your team fail anyway, but with a buffer of 2 this means that only 1 of your team has failed.
For a team of 20, a distribution performance of -3 would mean 6 should fail, but only 2 fail with a buffer of  2.

But i think this needs some work. Lets say that a team rolls with a buffer of 0. Then ideally, rolling a distribution of 5 (giving a distribution performance of -1) should really make 2 team members fail.

## team roll system
So you want to make a team roll, eh? dont want to roll 10 individual d20s so you just want to roll 1 eh? well good luck with that. Here's how Allesfezs Ekarschubi models a distribution of team success and failure! HAHAHAHAH!

You have a success value s, determined normally for a unit.
You then make a team performance roll t, which is a normal d20. You want this to meet or beat the success value, but due to the distribution of team performance some of your units will still succeed or fail this.

Then, you calculate the buffer b with t - s. You minus the team performance roll with the success value. This value determines how many models in your team will still succeed if you roll badly on a distribution dice.

whats a distribution dice? GLAD YOU ASKED!!
A distribution die is a five-sided die with the numbers (-4, -2, 0, +2, +4) on it. a distribution dice roll is two of these added together. This directly gives you a distribution performance d. 
You can use normal d5s, but then you have to convert your roll into a distribution performance with 2r-6, whereas a distribution dice roll gives it directly.
You then calculate the distributed success value f with b + d. This represents the overall success of a team, with negative values representing failure. 
If this value is positive and you rolled underneath the success value, then some models succeed anyway. If it is negative and you rolled over the success value, then some models will fail anyway.
The exact number of models depends on your team size. To find the exact number of models that the distributed success value affects, round your team size (n') to the nearest 5 and multiply the distributed success value by n'/10. 

Team rolls can go five ways.
- The team roll is bad and the distribution is bad. The team fails
- The team roll is bad but the distribution is good. Some models in the team might still succeed
- The distribution is 0. The team roll determines whole team success
- The team roll is good and the distribution is bad. Some models in the team might fail.
- The team roll is good and the distribution is good. The team succeeds.

Teams will have to make this type of roll mostly for attacks and armour saves.
