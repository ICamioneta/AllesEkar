I have decided to make some units for my own purposes. As the creator of [[Allesfezs Ekarschubi]], I probably know what stats units should have, so you can use these as examples.

These are profiles for the archetypal American western frontier person. I’ll only do quite inexperienced profiles, which you can use and then upgrade through the experience system in running games.

# The Elder Scrolls
I’m a massive elder scrolls fangirl so when I saw a bunch of elder scrolls models, I grabbed those to get them. Maybe I’ll paint them later? Anyway, I might as well use them to make inbuilt units.

## The Elder Scrolls special rules:
The Elder Scrolls has a couple quirky things that need their own special rules in this game. Here they are:
### Magic Thu’um
Magic Thu’um is a version of the magic skill with its own spells and targeting rules. These magic spells have a level. If a unit has one of a higher level, they can also cast the lower level variants.

Regular Shout (range) targeting method describes the following: select a target that is a distance up to the range away from the caster. Every unit in a line drawn from the caster to the target is also affected. If the target makes a dodge/adjust action or a block action, this goes head-to-head with your magic skill check.

Cooldown (time) describes the number of activations this unit must finish before they can use any Magic Thu’um again.

| Name                             | Targeting           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Unrelenting Force 3 (Fus Ro Dah) | Regular Shout (10”) | Move affected units directly away from the caster a distance up to 2”. Affected units cannot make actions or reactions other than dodge/adjust, block, until the end of their next activation.<br><br>Cooldown (3) |
